This code is for my bachelors thesis about unethical use of gamification in modern online marketplaces.
The code and dataset can be found from the file data and algorithms.

files in the data and algorithms folder:

rows: Running this program results in a graph of how much gamification each application has used.

columns: Running this program results in a graph showing the amount a certain gamification element has been used.

Kmodes: Running this program results in a xlsx file which contains all the clusters formed by the program. It also includes the names of the applications and into which cluster they belong to.

This code base is open source and free to use under the MIT license.
